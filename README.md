The *Ethnic Diversity in Xinjiang Data Set* seeks to map changes in the ethnic diversity in Xinjiang at the county level based on official government statistics. 

The start date of the current version is the year 2000, the end date is 2018 - the last year for which group-specific demographic information are available. 

For each county-year a measure of ethnic fractionalisation and polarisation is provided.
